I'm a postgraduate student at the University of Oxford pursuing a joint M.Sc. degree between the [[https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/][Mathematical Institute]] and [[https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/][Department of Computer Science]] at the [[https://www.ox.ac.uk/][University of Oxford]] as a member of [[https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/][Exeter College]].
Before pursuing this degree I did undergraduate at Purdue University and a spent a couple of years at MongoDB.
